# ASCII<->IMG
 A program for converting images to ASCII and back again
- Most common image formats can be used
- I recommend using images with a width smaller than 1024 as this is the character limit of lines in notepad, but with a high enough resolution to remain sharp when converted.
- Images with a width larger than 1024 can be used, but increase the scale factor to have them properly displayed in notepad. 
- Change font size in notepad to 1 to havetbr image properly displayed. 

*This program has no error checking of any kind*
