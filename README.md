# ASCII<->IMG
 A program for converting images to ASCII and back again
- Most common image formats can be used
- I recommend using images with a width smaller than 1024 as this is the character limit of lines in notepad, but with a high enough resolution to remain sharp when converted.

*As of now, there is no error checking of any kind*
